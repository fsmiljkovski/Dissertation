Designing and developing a mobile application to improve communication between students and lecturers, which can be used during in class or online lecture. Application is developed with hybrid technology to accommodate different mobile phones used by students.Designed and developed in Flutter and Firebase, main target of the application was to increase engagement in lectures for students with anxiety (which is growing category), shy or afraid to ask questions, by giving them opportunity to anonymously ask questions during the lecture and gain better understanding of the topic.Lecturers are required to create an account through email or Google Authentication as well as their classes and lectures in the application and provide access keys to the students. By using the access key, students will be able to join the lecture and will be allowed later on to anonymously ask questions on the dedicated page, as well as discuss each question in the given chat room.Firebase was used as a database, which allowed for user creation either through email, phone or Google Authentication, as well as data storage.
